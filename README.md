# My Portfolio

Welcome to the GitHub repository of my personal portfolio website. Here, I've created a space to introduce myself, showcase my skills, and express my passion for what I do. It serves as a platform where I share my projects and experiences.

## About the Portfolio

I've developed this portfolio using React from the ground up. The backend features a basic Express server designed for handling email submissions, with plans to expand its functionality in the future. The portfolio's frontend is powered by Bootstrap, showcasing my technical skills while maintaining functionality. Please note that the portfolio is currently under development, with new features actively being added.

## Key Features

- **Multilingual Support**: The portfolio is accessible in both English and Hungarian, featuring dynamic language switching.
- **Contact Section**: An integrated contact form facilitates email submissions.
- **Animations and Particles**: Thoughtfully implemented animations and particles enhance the visual experience.
- **Continuous Development**: The site is a dynamic work in progress, continuously evolving with new ideas and as time permits.

**Note**: As of now, the portfolio is still under development and remains unhosted. Upon completion, I intend to publish it for public access.
